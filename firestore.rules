/**
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset implements a role-based access control (RBAC) model
 * for the AttendanceEase application. Authorization is determined by a user's
 * role. Admins have broad management capabilities over core data like courses,
 * students, and user roles. Designated 'Users' have the specific permission to mark attendance.
 *
 * Data Structure: The structure separates roles and data entities into distinct
 * top-level collections: /users, /students, and /courses.
 * Course-specific data, such as enrollments (`/students`) and `attendance_records`,
 * are nested within their parent `/courses/{courseId}` document. This hierarchical
 * layout enables intuitive, path-based security and performant queries.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Role by Document Existence: A user is an 'Admin' if a document with their UID
 *   exists in the `/admins` collection. A user is a 'User' if a document
 *   with their UID exists in the `/users` collection. This is a scalable and secure
 *   way to manage roles without relying on custom claims or hardcoded values.
 * - Granular Permissions: 'Users' can create attendance records, but only 'Admins'
 *   can modify or delete them, ensuring data integrity and providing an audit trail.
